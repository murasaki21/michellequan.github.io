      <p><!--My passion for art wasn't born from a specific epiphany nor a date. But I would say it began some time in elementary school with doodling in the margins of papers. With time, those pencil doodles gradually evolved into flowers, faces, and more. While it began creating a line, without much thought, as the line continued, the reason behind continuing that line slowly grew- I want to share my story and the passion behind it.-->Most of my work comprises of videos and digital art, but I have delved into other mediums such as photography, code, AR and still exploring. </p>
  <br>
      <p>While unorthodox, talking to myself helps in the creative process. Afterall, a thought is simply an unexpressed idea. While talking has its benefits, I may sometimes write down my thoughts or doodle them. Overall, I do not have a true method I strictly follow because I feel that contradicts with the freedom of expression in art. Usually I express my ideas through pencil, not only because it can be used almost anytime and anywhere, but this was the medium that sparked my passion. It stuck with me, through dark and light, thick and thin, literally and figuratively. With videos, in highschool, telling a story or informing someone through thousands of pictures strung together intrigued me, motivating me to create videos. Like video, my interest in graphic art piqued in high school as well. Learning how to use Photoshop and Illustrator greatly expanded my knowledge in how to inform or sway someone with simply images and text. How a font change or the size of an image can greatly impact my message. Like I previously said, while I love using pencil, making videos, and creating graphic art, I am still exploring and trying new ways to share my art.</p>
